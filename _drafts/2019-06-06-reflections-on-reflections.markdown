Seven years ago, I had an intriguing idea. [Mathematical reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics)) are linear transformations that flip a coÃ¶rdinate system across a line. They're analogous to [physical reflections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)), if you could view both a scene and its reflection from above. However, unlike physical reflections, in which images may be reflected in [non-planar (curved) mirrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curved_mirror), mathematical reflections are always linear. You can reflect in a line, or a [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_reflection), but that's it. Linear reflections and point reflections aren't even the same kind of transformation.

I asked the natural question:
> Why isn't there a notion of "nonlinear reflection"?

This was swiftly followed by:
> Does such a concept even make sense?

and:
> If so, what would such reflections look like?

It turns out that these are far more interesting question to ask than I had ever expected. In fact, asking these questions led almost inevitably to a beautiful web of connections between geometric concepts that previously had seemed entirely unrelated.
